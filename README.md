# CPP_ArenaAllocator

  Used to understand usage of memory and its allocation in a general sense to how memory is managed
in RAM. Works with an arena-type allocator and unit testing to display understanding of how the code
looks under the hood in which makes it work. Mainly working with exceptions like outOfBounds, doubleFree,
as well as outOfMemory to show how issues can arise, and be caught and managed in a way which is concurrent with a ADT model.
